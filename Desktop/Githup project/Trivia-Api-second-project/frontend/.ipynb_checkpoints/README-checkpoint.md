# Frontend - Trivia API

## Getting Setup

> _tip_: this frontend is designed to work with [Flask-based Backend](../backend) so it will not load successfully if the backend is not working or not connected. We recommend that you **stand up the backend first**, test using Postman or curl, update the endpoints in the frontend, and then the frontend should integrate smoothly.

### Installing Dependencies

1. **Installing Node and NPM**
   This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. **Installing project dependencies**
   This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

> _tip_: `npm i`is shorthand for `npm install``

## Required Tasks

### Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use `npm start`. You can change the script in the `package.json` file.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

```bash
npm start
```

### Request Formatting

The frontend should be fairly straightforward and disgestible. You'll primarily work within the `components` folder in order to understand, and if you so choose edit, the endpoints utilized by the components. While working on your backend request handling and response formatting, you can reference the frontend to view how it parses the responses.

After you complete your endpoints, ensure you return to the frontend to confirm your API handles requests and responses appropriately:

- Endpoints defined as expected by the frontend
- Response body provided as expected by the frontend

### Optional: Updating Endpoints and API behavior

Would you rather the API had different behavior - different endpoints, return the response body in a different format? Go for it! Make the updates to your API and the corresponding updates to the frontend so it works with your API seamlessly.

### Optional: Styling

In addition, you may want to customize and style the frontend by editing the CSS in the `stylesheets` folder.

### Optional: Game Play Mechanics

Currently, when a user plays the game they play up to five questions of the chosen category. If there are fewer than five questions in a category, the game will end when there are no more questions in that category.

You can optionally update this game play to increase the number of questions or whatever other game mechanics you decide. Make sure to specify the new mechanics of the game in the README of the repo you submit so the reviewers are aware that the behavior is correct.

> **Spoiler Alert:** If needed, there are details below regarding the expected endpoints and behavior. But, ONLY look at them if necessary. Give yourself the opportunity to practice understanding code first!

## DO NOT PROCEED: ENDPOINT SPOILERS

> Only read the below to confirm your notes regarding the expected API endpoint behavior based on reading the frontend codebase.



# API Reference
---
### Getting Started
 - Base URL: This app can only be run locally.
   - The backend app is hosted at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   - The frontend react app is hosted at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
 - Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.
 -
 
###  Installing Dependencies

Navigate to the **/backend** directory and run 

cd backend
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
This will install all of the required packages we selected within the requirements.txt file.
### Start Backend Server
 export FLASK_APP=flaskr
 export FLASK_ENV=development
 flask run
### Erorr Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:

```json
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```
The API will return four error types when requests fail:
 - 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 405: Method Not Found
- 422: Not Processable
- 500: Internal Server Error
